| robot_run_cafe_LA_analysis |  This is the How to Tell a Story Using Data Project. The aim of the project is to prepare some market research on a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles. We analyze the current market conditions to conclude if we will be able to maintain success when the novelty of robot waiters wears off. We also have attached a precise presentation in the end which will help in making clear decision. | *pandas* , *matplotlib*, *seaborn*, *usaddress*|
