| video_games_analytics |  This is the First Integrated Project of all the previous modules of Data Preprocessing, EDA and SDA. The aim of the project is to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not which will allow in spotting potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns. Here we  investigated user and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources for the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. We have data which is going back to 2016 for planning a campaign for 2017. The dataset contains the abbreviation ESRB. The Entertainment Software Rating Board evaluates a game's content and assigns an age rating such as Teen or Mature. | *pandas* , *matplotlib*, *scipy*|
