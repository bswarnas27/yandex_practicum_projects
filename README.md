## Project desriptions are in this README.md

These projects were completed for Practicum's Data Analyst Program.

| Project name | Description | Libraries used | 
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
| analyzing_borrowers_defaulting_risk |  This is the first project of the program where we learn Data Preprocessing. The project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. We find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children have an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness.The report will be considered when building a credit score for a potential customer. A credit score is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.| *pandas* |
| research_car_sales_ad |  This is the Exploratory Data Analysis Project where we acted as an analyst at Crankshaft List. Hundreds of free advertisements for vehicles are published on your site every day. We studied data collected over the last few years and determine which factors influence the price of a vehicle. | *pandas* , *matplotlib*|
| analyzing_telecom_client's_behaviour |  This is the Statistical Data Analysis Project where we acted as an analyst the telecom operator Megaline, which offers it's clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget.  Carried out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection to analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue. | *pandas* , *matplotlib*, *scipy*|
| video_games_analytics |  This is the First Integrated Project of all the previous modules of Data Preprocessing, EDA and SDA. The aim of the project is to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not which will allow in spotting potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns. Here we  investigated user and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources for the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. We have data which is going back to 2016 for planning a campaign for 2017. The dataset contains the abbreviation ESRB. The Entertainment Software Rating Board evaluates a game's content and assigns an age rating such as Teen or Mature. | *pandas* , *matplotlib*, *scipy*|
| cab_company_client_weather_analysis |  This is the SQL Project where we worked as an analyst for Zuber, a ride-sharing company that's launched in Chicago. The task is to find patterns in the available information. We understood passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. We studied the database, analyzed data from competitors, and tested a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency. We worked with both SQL and Python to study the pattern.  | *pandas* , *matplotlib*, *scipy*|
