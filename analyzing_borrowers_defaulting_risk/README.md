| analyzing_borrowers_defaulting_risk |  This is the first project of the program where we learn Data Preprocessing. The project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. We find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children have an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness.The report will be considered when building a credit score for a potential customer. A credit score is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.| *pandas* |
