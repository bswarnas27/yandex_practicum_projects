| cab_company_client_weather_analysis |  This is the SQL Project where we worked as an analyst for Zuber, a ride-sharing company that's launched in Chicago. The task is to find patterns in the available information. We understood passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. We studied the database, analyzed data from competitors, and tested a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency. We worked with both SQL and Python to study the pattern.  | *pandas* , *matplotlib*, *scipy*|
