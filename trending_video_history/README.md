|  trending_video_history  | Here we use Tableau to visualize history of the trending youtube videos. The aim of the project is to answer these questions:
- Which video categories trended most often?
- How were they distributed among regions?
- What categories were especially popular in the United States? Were there any differences between the categories popular in the US and those popular elsewhere? | *Tableau Software*|
