| recommender_system_test |  This is the Final A/B Testing Project. The purpose of the project is to test changes related to the introduction of an improved recommendation system of the online store. The expected result: within 14 days of signing up, users will show better conversion into product page views (the product_page event), instances of adding items to the shopping cart (product_cart), and purchases (purchase). At each stage of the funnel product_page → product_cart → purchase, there will be at least a 10% increase.  | *pandas* , *matplotlib*, *scipy*, *datetime*, *math*|
